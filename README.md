engr.am is a simple tool to fit my need for a bookmarking tool. Rather than having several browser plugins, engr.am gets you ninety percent of the functionality with:

```
engr.am/http://myfavouritesite.com
```

very simple.

* **locally-hosted**: I prefer to have control over my own bookmarks, and it is frustrating trying to save 
links on a bad network.

* **archiving**: engr.am creates a PDF copy of every bookmark. The result isn't always pretty, but it guarantees you'll never lose data through link-rotting.

* **sharing**: engr.am supports Twitter sharing without using .

* **api**:

## Tags

engr.am does not support manual tagging, as it is hard to assign meaningful tags to many bookmarks without mislabelling. Instead, engr.am extracts keywords from your documents you can use to search by.

## Search 

<kbd>Ctrl + F</kbd>

## Licence

engr.am is released under the MIT licence.
